# Sonic-Core: Innovation Roadmap (2026)

This roadmap outlines the transition of Sonic-Core from a linear rack-based workstation into a visually-driven, desktop-integrated, and social-ready production powerhouse.

## 🚀 Planned Features

### Phase 1: Distribution - Automated Social Visualizer Export
**Goal:** Enable users to instantly turn their mastered tracks into frequency-reactive videos for social media.
*   **Blueprint:** `blueprint-feat1.md`
*   **Key Tech:** FFmpeg.wasm, WebGL, OffscreenCanvas.
*   **Status:** Planned.

### Phase 2: Integration - Local Plugin Wrapper (VST/AU Bridge)
**Goal:** Bridge the gap between the web and the desktop by allowing the PWA to utilize native VST3 and Audio Unit plugins installed on the user's machine.
*   **Blueprint:** `blueprint-feat2.md`
*   **Key Tech:** Rust/Node.js Bridge, Localhost IPC, SharedArrayBuffer.
*   **Status:** Planned.

### Phase 3: UX Evolution - Reactive Node Graph View
**Goal:** Move beyond the linear rack to a fully modular "visual wire" environment for infinite routing flexibility.
*   **Blueprint:** `blueprint-feat3.md`
*   **Key Tech:** React Flow, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) state, Parallel Engine Architecture.
*   **Status:** Planned.

### Phase 4: Developer Velocity - "SonicForge" Autogen (Forge-to-Worklet Bridge)
**Goal:** Automate the "Trinity Pattern" boilerplate generation (Zig → TypeScript → React) to rapidly scale the DSP processor library with zero friction.
*   **Blueprint:** `blueprint-feat4.md`
*   **Key Tech:** Node.js/Python Parsing, AST Generation, AST-driven AST Code Generation, Template Literals, Zig metadata parsing.
*   **Status:** Planned.

### Phase 5: Engine Foundation - "Sonic-STL" (Standard Transform Library)
**Goal:** Standardize core DSP algorithms (FFT, Windowing, Resampling) at the Zig compile-time level to ensure high performance, consistency, and zero-drift computation across 40+ plugins.
*   **Blueprint:** `blueprint-feat5.md`
*   **Key Tech:** Zig `comptime`, Fixed-size Compile-time FFTs, Math primitives optimization.
*   **Status:** Planned.
