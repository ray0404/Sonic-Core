the following new CLI ("command-based") implementation is meant to be implemented "alongside"/concurrently/parallel to existing TUI (both existing and fully functional)

In this new worktree/branch, develop a robust, intuitive CLI (as opposed to existing TUI implementation) for processing audio using processors within this project (and within project's dependancies and/or "other" CLI deps/libraries/packages, as seen fit). it should be capabale of *at least* processing audio using individual and "chained" processors ("plugins"), essential FFmpeg (and/or similar) CLI standards). a method for utilizing JSON (or other/similar) configuration files for (pre)-defined processor "chains" (while maintaining ability to adjust processor params at time of command) and other "pre-process/analysis/function" and "advanced" configurations, needs implementation. a way/option to "preview" audio stream (either scrubbable and/or able to define start time), to assess audio changes beffore committing to (file) state; a way to "A/B" compare pre-processed vs processed audio needs to be implemented as well/with this.                                                                                                      This was a brief list of required features; include any other additional capabilities thatbmay be useful. Include other useful capabilities to this cli implementation that may be useful for audio processing and/or that (adds) "robustness" to the cli implementation. All capabilities should be completely/mostly "modular" function/interaction, as to ensure most useful/robust configration(s) for "advanced" audio processing.                                                                                                 While defining cli commands/options/flags, utilize FFmpeg's "nested" cli option/flag passing (i.e., "-b:a:0", et.,) as seen fit/useful, to enhance user understandibility and usage of processing audio via this cli implementation method.
                                                                 (Liberally) make/comduct web searches in order to reference/aid in high-quality development/integration of this feature.
